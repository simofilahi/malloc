# Malloc - Dynamic Memory Allocation

## Overview

This repository is part of the 42 School program, focusing on implementing a dynamic memory allocation system in C. The project emulates the behavior of the C standard library functions `malloc`, `free`, and `realloc`.

## Structure

The project includes:
- Source files in `srcs`
- Header files in `includes`
- A main file for testing in `main.c`
- Build scripts including a `Makefile` and `run.sh`

## Getting Started

To use or contribute to this memory allocation library, clone the repository and follow the build instructions:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/simofilahi/malloc.git
cd malloc
make
